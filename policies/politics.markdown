Seneca Systems is apolitical.

While our individual employees have personal politics of many flavors, our company endorses none. We do not donate to campaign fundraisers or political action committees. Our commitment is to serving the hardworking employees of state and local governments. We believe it is the people's perogative to elect representatives and Seneca's duty to help them once in office.
