Seneca Systems has a very strict no-gift policy.

Anything with monetary value may not be given or accepted by any member of our company to or from any government official or related entity. That applies regardless of any looser regulations on their part (e.g. gifts under $25), regardless of the setting (e.g. it was given as a friend, not as a potential customer), and regardless of the technicalities (e.g. he was a member of her election campaign, not technically a government employee himself).

If money and politics are involved, Seneca should not be. We want to make sure you and the company are protected from bias, so just don't make assumptions. If you have doubts, questions, or concerns, ask Chris.

Given our work with public officials and civil servants—keeping in mind the sometimes questionable, other times outright fraudulent relationship between contractors and their customers in our industry—our motives should always be clear and upfront.

We aim for our products to be the best. If they cannot win on their merits, backed by the passionate and talented individuals who build and support them, then we should not win the deal.

We recognize that this may make things harder.  
Doing the right thing sometimes is.  
We do it anyway.

## Personal Donations

We recognize that employees have personal political interests and encourage them to get involved. To prevent bias or inappropriate relationships, if an employee has donated to any campaign (political or otherwise) related to a government employee then they should not be involved with Seneca's relationship with that employee. For example, if a representative decides to raise money for cancer research by running a marathon, you are welcome to donate to their cause. You may not, however, work on their account for the company.
