Seneca Systems was founded in November 2014 with the mission of empowering civil servants to enrich the lives of their citizens. We believe that government can be better than it is and that we have the power to make that change happen. By building powerful and delightful tools, providing ridiculously excellent customer support, and taking on the most pressing challenges facing governments, we will have far greater impact than building an app to help you find a taco truck.
