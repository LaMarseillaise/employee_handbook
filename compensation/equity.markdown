# Compensation – Equity

## Vesting

Seneca Systems has a one year cliff with a four year vesting schedule. All equity follows the same schedule, including founders and any advisors we may bring on board.

We believe employees are more valuable the longer they remain with the company. To reflect this, our vesting schedule is progressively weighted towards the later years.

Month 12: 17.5% (cliff)

Months 13-24: 22.5% (1/12th, monthly)

Months 25-36: 27.5% (1/12th, monthly)

Months 37-48: 32.5% (1/12th, monthly)

In exchange for the risk the employee takes on by weighting the vesting schedule as such, we are committed to offering at least 110% of market rate in equity for a given position/timeframe.
