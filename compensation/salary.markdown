# Compensation â€“ Salary

## No individual negotiation

Salaries are non-negotiable for individual offers. We research  compensation beforehand and make offers we feel to be fair and competitive.

Salaries are tied to roles, not individuals. If we collectively believe that a position should recieve a raise, it is an indication that we value that role more than the current salary. In that case, we will bump compensation for every employee at that role.

The consequences of this are that employees negotiate as a group rather than being pressured to do so as individuals. We see the advantages as two-fold for the employee:

1. Employees whose negotiating skills are above or below their performance will not be rewarded or penalized as such.

2. There is no opportunity for pay discrimination within a given role. If you are deemed qualified to perform a role and continue to do so, you can be confident that you will be compensated equal to everyone else.

## Transparency

As a result of our no-negotiation policy and posting salaries along with job postings, it is silly to try and keep salaries secret. As such, the salary of every position will be available to every employee. We encourage active discussion on salary.

## Pay Schedule

Employees will be paid via ACH (bank direct deposit) on the 15th and 30th of the month. Federal and state taxes will be withheld.

## Automatic salary adjustment

Every role's compensation will be bumped annually to adjust for inflation according the the Consumer Price Index. In the case of deflation below 2%, compensation *will not* be revised downward.
