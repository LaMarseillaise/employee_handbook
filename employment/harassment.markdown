# Employment â€“ Harrassment

Seneca Systems does not tolerate harassment. We believe in providing a safe, supportive, empowering, and productive work environment for every employee.

If you feel threatened, harassed, or uncomfortable, please speak with your manager. If, for any reason, you do not feel comfortable bringing up the issue with your manager, either Chris or Nick is always available. No issue is too trivial; a good sign that you should speak up is that you are thinking about whether or not you should speak up.

While we would prefer to hear about issues directly, we understand that oftentimes people do not feel comfortable with conflict. If you see, hear, or feel that a member of our community is being harassed, bullied, or threatened, it is your responsibility to speak with someone about it.

Every time.

Even if you think someone else will or has.
