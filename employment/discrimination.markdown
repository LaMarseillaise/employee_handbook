# Employment â€“ Discrimination

Under no circumstances will we discriminate any candidate for a position at Seneca Systems by:

- race
- gender identity
- sexual orientation
- politics
- religion
- disability or any medical condition (e.g. HIV)
- age
- physical characteristics (height, weight, subjective attractiveness)
- ancestry or nationality

We can provide a legal rationale for not discriminating on arbitrary characteristics. There is also a very good business case for anti-discrimination policies. In addition to and above those reasons, we will not discriminate because we fundamentally believe it is wrong.

The above list is not exhaustive; if you think of other characteristics that should be explicitly mentioned, please speak to Chris (chris@seneca.systems).
