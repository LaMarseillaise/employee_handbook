# Benefits – Leave

## Vacation

Employees may take as much vacation time as they need, within reason. We *do* count the days you take, as we require employees to take a minimum number of days off per year.

In many companies, unlimited PTO leads to never taking much vacation at all. This is psychologically harmful and puts undue pressure on the employee to “justify” why they are taking time off now, when they can take it any time.

To combat this, Seneca Systems has a minimum vacation policy. Employees must take at least fifteen (15) days off per year. You may do anything you like, but you may not be in the office.

## Family Leave

12 weeks paid leave + 12 weeks unpaid leave.

This applies to new parents (whether adoption or birth, both parents) as well as any other family-related causes such as deaths or caring for sick family.

These days do not count *towards* your minimum vacation time off; we do not consider caring for a newborn to be “vacation.”

## Jury Duty

Jury duty is a public service and we are all about public service! Paid time off for you, Glen CoCo!
Time taken for jury duty does not count towards our minimum vacation policy.
